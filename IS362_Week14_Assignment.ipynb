I chose Netflix because the huge customer base they have and the enormous amounts of data that Netflix collects about their customer base. Prior to their current recommender system, Netflix used a star based review system to based recommendations on. Users would return DVD's and then rate the video from 1-5 stars. This provided two functions, to confirm that the customer actually watched the video and to have a basis for recommending similarly rated movies to the user. This method was crude but at the time was the best the internet had to offer."

Another important step to take is to rate the videos you watch which helps feed information to the algorithm. This also lets Netflix know what movies or shows their user base is interested in and can be a big help in providing Netflix with what content to host or produce next."

This would help retain their userbase and very possibly help them recruit new users to their service. "

Netflix adapts to these viewing changes very quickly which can skew my recommendations. I would say that Netflix should possibly wait longer before incorporating new views into the algorithm. They could also possibly make a recommended for you category that only reflects recently viewed movies while your original recommendations could be more tailored towards your actual viewing habits."
